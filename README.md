# AgarVision: ML-powered app to detect, analyze and count agar plate bacteria colonies.
Accurate and efficient analysis of bacterial colonies on agar plates is a crucial task in biotechnology research. Traditional manual counting methods are time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this challenge, this research book presents an ML-powered mobile application that revolutionizes the colony analysis process. By leveraging advanced convolutional neural networks, specifically the YOLO (You Only Look Once) or SSD (Single-Shot Multibox Detector) algorithms, These algorithms excel in real-time object detection tasks by efficiently analyzing images and identifying objects of interest, such as bacterial colonies, with high precision. The application automates the detection and counting of bacterial colonies in agar plates. Biotechnology researchers can simply capture a photo of an agar plate using the app, enabling the intelligent software to count the number of colonies present accurately.
We have successfully implemented a combination of algorithms that detects and counts colonies. thus, we are confident that our app will meet our demands. This streamlined process not only saves time and improves accuracy but also empowers researchers to focus on their core objectives, ultimately enhancing productivity in the biotechnology field.
